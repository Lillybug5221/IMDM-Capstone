# Design Values

### Short Description
This project is a short 2D pixel-art game developed in Unity. It focuses on atmosphere, visuals, and worldbuilding within a small, forested town setting. The tone blends warmth and mystery, with the goal of creating a cohesive and immersive experience that draws players in through detail and presentation rather than gameplay complexity.

### Experience
Players progress through a small-town environment, interacting with its people and uncovering moments that build a sense of place. The game combines dialogue and visual storytelling to create an emotional connection to the world and its characters. It’s meant to feel familiar and immersive, encouraging players to pay attention to the details that make the setting come alive.

### Theme
The game explores the feeling of discovering a place that carries both comfort and mystery. Meaning should come mainly through setting and visual tone rather than just through overt explanation. Dialogue and events reveal small stories and relationships that add depth to the environment, emphasizing how personal experiences shape the way we perceive the world around us.

### Point of View
The story is told from a side-view perspective. The tone aims to be cozy and personal, with moments of reflection or unease balanced by warmth and familiarity. Despite being short, it’s designed to leave the impression of having spent time inside a meaningful story rather than just completing a game.

### Artistic Style
The game uses detailed 2D pixel art that focuses on light, texture, and color to define the mood. Natural greens, muted browns, and cool tones contrast with soft, warm light sources to create depth and atmosphere. The visual direction aims for consistency and clarity, allowing the world’s tone and personality to come through in each scene.

### Challenges and Constraints
The player follows a narrative path, meeting characters and uncovering pieces of the story along the way. Interaction and discovery are guided but meaningful: each conversation or visual detail should add to the sense of connection with the setting. The challenge lies in staying engaged with the narrative and piecing together its emotional and thematic threads.

### Context
The game is designed for desktop play, either as a downloadable or web build. It isn’t tied to a physical space but could also be exhibited on a computer in a classroom or gallery setting. The target audience includes players who appreciate story-focused games with strong visual direction and tone.

### Emotion
The goal is for players to feel connected to the characters and find some sort of comfort in the setting, even as the story carries moments of uncertainty or change. Ideally, it should leave a lasting impression through its atmosphere and emotional weight and should be something that feels personal and memorable even after the experience ends.
