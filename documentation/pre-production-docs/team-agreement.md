# Team Agreement

*Note: This is currently meant as an individual project, so this agreement focuses on how I’ll structure my own workflow, tools, and feedback process instead of team collaboration.*

### Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a short 2D game that focuses on visuals, atmosphere, and worldbuilding. During this phase, I want to concentrate on building a playable version or prototype that feels cohesive and captures the tone I’m aiming for through art, environment, and pacing.

### Decision Making
Since I’m planning for this to be an individual project, formal group decision-making processes do not really apply here as most decisions will be made independently. However, I plan to seek external feedback from others such as peers and instructors throughout development to ensure the project remains on track creatively and technically and to get outside perspectives when refining ideas or solving problems.

### Collaboration Tools
Version control and project files will be managed through GitHub and Unity. Documentation and notes will be maintained in GitHub or Notion, with Notion also used for task tracking and project management.

### Meetings per Week
While I won’t have group meetings since these are not applicable to me as the sole developer of this project, I’ll be sure to review my progress each week and update documentation to reflect what’s been completed and what’s next as well as what I worked on and learned.

### Participation Expectations 
I plan to dedicate around 10 hours per week to this project, but expect the workload to vary per stage and for it to likely increase when working on creating and implementing art assets or refining gameplay.
