# Roles & Responsabilities

*Note: Since I’m working on this project alone, I’ll be taking on all production roles for this project. The following breakdown outlines the different areas/roles I expect to take on throughout development and the main responsibilities that come with each.*

### Project Design and Management 
I’ll be responsible for the overall design and direction of the game, including concept development, structure, pacing, and tone. I’ll also be updating the project documents throughout production to reflect the project status as well as any adjustments in creative goals or priorities.

### Programming
I’ll handle all Unity development, including implementing core mechanics, setting up player movement, environment interactions, and basic dialogue systems. I’ll also manage integration of art and sound assets into the Unity project.

### Art Direction
I’m directing the visual style of the project, including color palettes, lighting, and environmental design. I’ll create concept sketches and/or visual references to guide consistency throughout the art pipeline.

### Asset Creation and Animation
All pixel art assets and animations will be created by me using tools like Piskel, Asprite, and Photoshop. This includes characters, environments, props, and UI elements. Once finalized, I’ll import and test these assets in Unity to ensure they display and animate properly.

### Sound Design
I’ll curate and/or create audio assets such as ambient sounds, footsteps, and environmental effects to support the tone of the game. If needed, I may seek feedback or limited collaboration for music and sound balancing later in production.

### Prototyping and Testing
I’ll lead the prototyping phase, focusing first on creating a small playable scene that demonstrates the intended mechanics and atmosphere. During testing, I’ll share builds with peers and instructors for feedback, then make adjustments to improve usability, pacing, and player experience.
