# Design Values Document:

Short description of your installation: Describe in brief the core characteristics of your installation: Idea,  Spatial design, Number of simultaneous participants,   and primary techniques involved (AR|VR|PROJECTION| OTHER).
* My installation is an immersive experience centered around inter-language synonyms. It makes use of projection mapping, machine learning, audio input, and potentially computer vision to make words move around in an aquarium or pond as if they were fish. 

Experience:  What do the participants get to do when experiencing your installation?  How does it make them feel physically or emotionally?
* They can add word-fish to the experience by entering whatever word they want. This attaches them to the installation and lets them feel like they have contributed. I want them to feel at peace when they view this aquarium.

Theme:  What is the Installation about?  How does it represent this to the participants?   What concepts, Perspectives, or experiences might the participants encounter during the experience? How are these delivered?  (Through a story/Image/metaphor? ).
* See above - this installation is about the travel of words throughout languages and how words which mean the same thing in different languages carry varying definitions and connotations.

Point of view:  What does the participant see, hear, or feel? From what cultural reference point?
* The cultural reference point is that of their own culture. They see the fish, hear a sort of calming background music (think Super Mario Galaxy, calm, introspective). They feel at peace.
 
Artistic Style: How is the information within it represented? Is it very realistically detailed?  How is the style correlated to your concept and storytelling approach?   We relate to Concept Art as part of the director’s nonverbal statement about the installation's theme.  It’s a storytelling tool that conveys a message through artistic style, editing style, and movement.  If you already envisioned an artistic style for your work, check it and tweak it according to these criteria. 
* It is stylized, but I am not yet sure how I want to stylize it. I would need to make some concept art in a sketcbook.

Challenges and constraints:   What are the participants encouraged to do? How do you make them active —emotionally or physically? 
* They are heavily encouraged (and potentially required) to add a word to the pond.

Context: Where is the installation placed?  Does it depend on a specific physical environment?  Who is your audience—could they be passersby, or does it ideally belong in a gallery?  (For art-oriented public?)
* Still not sure. As of right now I have been envisioning it in an indoor environment like a classroom, but I am not at all opposed to keeping it outside, though that would require more planning and thinking for the execution.

Emotion: How would you like your participants to feel after experiencing your installation?  What are they left with?
* I want them to leave with a sense of peace, but also a sense of curiosity as to the beauty of languages. If they go home and spend even a small amount of time thinking about how they use language in their day-to-day life, that is a success for me.
