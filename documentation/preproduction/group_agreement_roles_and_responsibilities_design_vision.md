# Team Agreements

### This agreement is aimed at creating a work method where each team member knows the production requirements  These may vary over time according to the production development: There may be stages where the workload will be higher for the conceptual directors, and in other stages, the tech and programming team will have to kick it with more time investment than in the early stages. 

This agreement aims to establish a working relationship  and timeframe where each of you knows your time requirement for individual work, as well as for group meetings and decision making. 

  * Goal: What is the purpose of the team which unifies you?
    * N/A because I am individual
  * Decision Making: Does everyone have to agree before making any change to the project? What happens in case of a disagreement? Is there a director who is in charge of the overall vision, and therefore gets to make the final decision based on the input of each member? 
    * N/A because I am individual
  * Collaboration tools:   How do you share files? What platform do you find most efficient and flexible for everyone to share and synchronize with others?
    * GitHub for commits, as well as a hard drive in case either fails and to save space. All assets would probably sit on the hard drive.
  * Meetings per week: (This should be updated as the project develops)
    * For now, spend about 2 hours a week as a check-in for oneself just to see where progress is and keep brainstorming
  * Please Specify  How many meetings per week besides class time, and on which platform (In person/Zoom/other).
    * I would hope in person. It would be weird to meet myself via Zoom.
  * Participation expectations:  An estimation of the scope of work in hours per week, expected from each group member. This will undergo changes as the project develops.
    * For now, around 2 hours a week outside of class, but as the project continues, increase to 4-5 (not sure depends on scale).

# Roles and Responsibilities (Who is doing what): 

## Installation design and Concepts:

**Because I am working alone, all the responsibilities will be taken on by myself.**

Who is directing the experience,  and if it is a shared thinking, how are decisions being made?    Whose responsibility is it to update the Design values document  along the production process?
* I am directing the experience.

    * Programming: Dhruv
    * Art Direction: Dhruv
    * Sound Design: Dhruv
    * Art Implementation: Animation \ Video\ live action,or any other source material manufacturing: Dhruv
    
Please specify responsibilities according to your installation components.  You should relate to modeling\ rigging  and animation as separate tasks, and specify who does what.  The same goes for live footage  shooting which requires  a  photographer,  and an editor.  All  the roles  involved in the making of your Installation’s  core material should be broken down to their creation process stages,  and specified.                  

 Direction of Prototyping  and Testing:   This responsibility may change and shift according to the prototype’s  nature: Naturally, tech  and core design prototypes should be managed by the programmers,  while art or other playtests could be directed by the art  and  concept  team members. 

 # Design Values Document:

Short description of your installation: Describe in brief the core characteristics of your installation: Idea,  Spatial design, Number of simultaneous participants,   and primary techniques involved (AR|VR|PROJECTION| OTHER).
* My installation is an immersive experience centered around inter-language synonyms. It makes use of projection mapping, machine learning, audio input, and potentially computer vision to make words move around in an aquarium or pond as if they were fish. 

Experience:  What do the participants get to do when experiencing your installation?  How does it make them feel physically or emotionally?
* They can add word-fish to the experience by entering whatever word they want. This attaches them to the installation and lets them feel like they have contributed. I want them to feel at peace when they view this aquarium.

Theme:  What is the Installation about?  How does it represent this to the participants?   What concepts, Perspectives, or experiences might the participants encounter during the experience? How are these delivered?  (Through a story/Image/metaphor? ).
* See above - this installation is about the travel of words throughout languages and how words which mean the same thing in different languages carry varying definitions and connotations.

Point of view:  What does the participant see, hear, or feel? From what cultural reference point?
* The cultural reference point is that of their own culture. They see the fish, hear a sort of calming background music (think Super Mario Galaxy, calm, introspective). They feel at peace.
 
Artistic Style: How is the information within it represented? Is it very realistically detailed?  How is the style correlated to your concept and storytelling approach?   We relate to Concept Art as part of the director’s nonverbal statement about the installation's theme.  It’s a storytelling tool that conveys a message through artistic style, editing style, and movement.  If you already envisioned an artistic style for your work, check it and tweak it according to these criteria. 
* It is stylized, but I am not yet sure how I want to stylize it. I would need to make some concept art in a sketcbook.

Challenges and constraints:   What are the participants encouraged to do? How do you make them active —emotionally or physically? 
* They are heavily encouraged (and potentially required) to add a word to the pond.

Context: Where is the installation placed?  Does it depend on a specific physical environment?  Who is your audience—could they be passersby, or does it ideally belong in a gallery?  (For art-oriented public?)
* Still not sure. As of right now I have been envisioning it in an indoor environment like a classroom, but I am not at all opposed to keeping it outside, though that would require more planning and thinking for the execution.

Emotion: How would you like your participants to feel after experiencing your installation?  What are they left with?
* I want them to leave with a sense of peace, but also a sense of curiosity as to the beauty of languages. If they go home and spend even a small amount of time thinking about how they use language in their day-to-day life, that is a success for me.
