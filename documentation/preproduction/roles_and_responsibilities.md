# Roles and Responsibilities (Who is doing what): 

## Installation design and Concepts:

**Because I am working alone, all the responsibilities will be taken on by myself.**

Who is directing the experience,  and if it is a shared thinking, how are decisions being made?    Whose responsibility is it to update the Design values document  along the production process?
* I am directing the experience.

    * Programming: Dhruv
    * Art Direction: Dhruv
    * Sound Design: Dhruv
    * Art Implementation: Animation \ Video\ live action,or any other source material manufacturing: Dhruv
    
Please specify responsibilities according to your installation components.  You should relate to modeling\ rigging  and animation as separate tasks, and specify who does what.  The same goes for live footage  shooting which requires  a  photographer,  and an editor.  All  the roles  involved in the making of your Installation’s  core material should be broken down to their creation process stages,  and specified.                  

 Direction of Prototyping  and Testing:   This responsibility may change and shift according to the prototype’s  nature: Naturally, tech  and core design prototypes should be managed by the programmers,  while art or other playtests could be directed by the art  and  concept  team members.
