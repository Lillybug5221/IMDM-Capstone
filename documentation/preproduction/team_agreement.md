# Team Agreements

### This agreement is aimed at creating a work method where each team member knows the production requirements  These may vary over time according to the production development: There may be stages where the workload will be higher for the conceptual directors, and in other stages, the tech and programming team will have to kick it with more time investment than in the early stages. 

This agreement aims to establish a working relationship  and timeframe where each of you knows your time requirement for individual work, as well as for group meetings and decision making. 

  * Goal: What is the purpose of the team which unifies you?
    * N/A because I am individual
  * Decision Making: Does everyone have to agree before making any change to the project? What happens in case of a disagreement? Is there a director who is in charge of the overall vision, and therefore gets to make the final decision based on the input of each member? 
    * N/A because I am individual
  * Collaboration tools:   How do you share files? What platform do you find most efficient and flexible for everyone to share and synchronize with others?
    * GitHub for commits, as well as a hard drive in case either fails and to save space. All assets would probably sit on the hard drive.
  * Meetings per week: (This should be updated as the project develops)
    * For now, spend about 2 hours a week as a check-in for oneself just to see where progress is and keep brainstorming
  * Please Specify  How many meetings per week besides class time, and on which platform (In person/Zoom/other).
    * I would hope in person. It would be weird to meet myself via Zoom.
  * Participation expectations:  An estimation of the scope of work in hours per week, expected from each group member. This will undergo changes as the project develops.
    * For now, around 2 hours a week outside of class, but as the project continues, increase to 4-5 (not sure depends on scale).
