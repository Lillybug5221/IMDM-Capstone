**Team Agreements**

This agreement is  aimed at creating  a work method  where  each team member  knows the production requirements  These  may vary over time according to the production development:  There may be stages where the workload will be higher for the conceptual directors,  and in other stages, the tech and programming team will have to kick it with more time investment than in the early stages.   
   
This agreement aims to establish a working relationship  and timeframe where each of you knows your time requirement for individual work, as well as for  group meetings  and decision making. 

*   ***Goal*** :   What is the purpose of the team which unifies you?   

The purposes of my project are: 

* To use immersive media to create an emotionally resonant storytelling experience about the Partition and its intergenerational impact.  
* Experiment with interactive projection design and TouchDesigner to visualize history and memory as a living, shifting entity.  
* Explore how personal narrative and collective history intersect through technology.  
* Strengthen my skills in interactive design, projection mapping, motion tracking, and sound integration.  
* Educate various audiences on the Partition, British colonialism, and South Asian history.  
* Preserve my family’s history and that of many others.

*    ***Decision   Making*** :  Does everyone have to agree  before making any change to the project?  What happens in case of a disagreement?  Is there a  director who is in charge of the overall vision, and therefore gets to make the final decision based on the input of each member? 

Since this is a personal/individual project, I will be the only one making decisions.

* ***Collaboration tools:***   How do you share files? What platform do you find most efficient and flexible for everyone to share and synchronize with others?

Since this is a personal/individual project, I will be the only one with the files.  
 

* ***Meetings per week***: (This should be updated as the project develops) 

  Please Specify  How many meetings  per week  besides class time,    and on which  platform (In person \\ Zoom\\ Other).

Since this is a personal/individual project, I will be the only one working on the project, but will allocate 3-4 hrs/week outside of class to work on the project.

*  ***Participation expectations:***  An estimation of the  Scope of work in hours per week, expected from each group member.  This will undergo changes as the project develops.  

Same as above.

**Roles and Responsibilities (Who is doing what):** 

* ***Installation design and Concepts:*** Humnah

Who is directing the experience,  and if it is a shared thinking, how are decisions being made?    Whose responsibility is it to update the Design values document  along the production process? 

* ***Programming:*** Humnah

* ***Art Direction :*** Humnah

* ***Sound Design:***  Humnah

*  ***Art Implementation: Animation \\ Video\\ live action,or any other source material manufacturing:***    Humnah                                                                           Please specify responsibilities according to your installation components.  You should relate to modeling\\ rigging  and animation as separate tasks, and specify who does what.  The same goes for live footage  shooting which requires  a  photographer,  and an editor.  All  the roles  involved in the making of your Installation’s  core material should be broken down to their creation process stages,  and specified.                


*  ***Direction of Prototyping  and Testing***: Humnah    
    This responsibility may change and shift according to the prototype’s  nature: Naturally, tech  and core design prototypes should be managed by the programmers,  while art or other playtests could be directed by the art  and  concept  team members.    

**Design Values Document:**

* ***Short description of your installation:*** Describe in brief the core characteristics of your installation: Idea,  Spatial design, Number of simultaneous participants,   and primary techniques involved (AR|VR|PROJECTION| OTHER).  
  * *Echoes of Partition* is an interactive projection installation that uses motion tracking to visualize memory and migration related to the 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan. It accommodates 1-3 participants at a time, who trigger layered visuals (maps, names, archival images, etc.) through their movement.

* ***Experience:***  What do the participants get to do when experiencing your installation?  How does it make them feel physically or emotionally?   
  * Participants move before the projection and see their silhouettes cause ripples through shifting layers of visuals. The experience evokes a sense of connection, reflection, and haunting beauty.

* ***Theme***:  What is the Installation about?  How does it represent this to the participants?   What concepts, Perspectives, or experiences might the participants encounter during the experience? How are these delivered?  (Through a story/Image/metaphor? ).   
  * The installation explores displacement, identity, and intergenerational memory caused by Partition. It conveys these ideas through visual metaphors \- fading maps, text, and echoes of ancestral voices \- representing how history is altered by, and lingers within, us.

* ***Point of view***:  What does the participant see, hear, or feel? From what cultural reference point?   
  * Participants see themselves reflected within historical imagery. They hear multilingual voices and sounds from the subcontinent, grounding them in South Asian cultural memory.

 

* ***Artistic Style***: How is the information within it represented? Is it very realistically detailed?  How is the style correlated to your concept and storytelling approach?   We relate to Concept Art as part of the director’s nonverbal statement about the installation's theme.  It’s a storytelling tool that conveys a message through artistic style, editing style, and movement.  If you already envisioned an artistic style for your work, check it and tweak it according to these criteria.   
  * The visuals blend realistic archival images into more abstract fluid layers that shift in response to motion. This style mirrors the fragmented, fading nature of history and inherited memory, enhancing the tone of my narrative.

* ***Challenges and constraints:***   What are the participants encouraged to do? How do you make them active —emotionally or physically?   
  * Participants are encouraged to move and observe to cause movement in the layers of sound and text. Their physical presence becomes part of the artwork, making them emotionally and physically engaged in uncovering the past.

* ***Context***: Where is the installation placed?  Does it depend on a specific physical environment?  Who is your audience—could they be passersby, or does it ideally belong in a gallery?  (For art-oriented public?)  
  * The installation is designed for a dimly-lit gallery or exhibition space where viewers can interact with it freely. My audience is both South Asian and non-South Asian audiences, especially those interested in migration and history.

* ***Emotion:*** How would you like your participants to feel after experiencing your installation?  What are they left with?    
  * I want participants to leave feeling moved, reflective, and connected, with a deeper awareness of how history endures through personal and collective memory. They should carry away a sense of empathy and reverence for the untold stories of Partition survivors.
